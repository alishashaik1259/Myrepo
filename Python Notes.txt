Datatypes
Strings
In Slicing the last index value[0:9] that is 9 is not included, means it is upto 9(not including 9th position in string)--- you can't use indexing to change individual elements of a string
Stringd are Immutable. Cant assign a new value to each index.----instead we can concat strings.

print('Python {}'.format('rules!'))=> Python rules!


lists 
lists are mutable

append
pop--basically remove the end value in a list.
sort
reverse

Dictionaries
Dictionaries are unordered and cant be sorted.
Dictionaries are mutable.
keys, values, items(tuples).


Tuples
Tuples are immutable(values cant be changed).
similar to lists. lists use [], but tuples use(). 
have very less methods when compared to lists
count
index

Sets
unorderd collection of unique elements.
{}
.add()

Booleans
True or False

Files
in python notebook to write a text file syntax is %%writefile filename.txt
.read()

inorder to read file multiple times , we need to reset the cursor to the start of the string, that can be done using 
.seek(0)
.readlines() ---to read the lines individually (as it is in the file, instead of single giant sentence with \n)

in order to open a file which is in an another path other than jupyter notebook, we should provide entire path.
myfile=open("C:\\path\\path\\path.txt")----backward slashes
filename.close() to close a file in order to avoid errors.
